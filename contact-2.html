    <h1>Brandon Huynh</h1>
    <p>Bryan: Okay, um, could you start with your name and your occupation?
    </p>
    <p>Brandon: So my name is Brandon and I'm currently an undergrad student at the University of Southern California.
    </p>
    <p>Bryan: Okay. So, um, have you always been passionate about orthodontics or dentistry?
    </p>
    <p>Brandon: I'd say my passion for dentistry and orthodontics goes way back into, like, middle school. I don't know why but, you know, during that time, I was already thinking about my career. But I felt like I had a specific affinity towards dentistry just because every time I went to the dentist, you know, my health was getting taken care of, you know, my teeth. I didn't grow up with the best- the best teeth but, you know, going to the dentist and, you know, having them check up on, you know, my oral health and, you know, helping me attain a better smile helped me boost my confidence.
    </p>
    <p>Bryan: So it was kind of like, along with treating people, itâ€™s kind of helping them kind of bring their confidence back?
    </p>
    <p>Brandon: Oh yeah, of course. You know, my family didn't really have the best dental health, so.. going to the dentist was something that helped me, you know, feel better about my teeth, you know. Our teeth weren't straight and my- my parents didn't have the time to, you know, care about these little things, they're not little, right, these are important, you know, your- your oral health is important for your speech, you know, for you to eat and so, you know, for me, I was pretty insecure about my smile, so going to the dentist helped me bring back that confidence especially after going to the orthodontist in high school, you know, I actually enjoyed the whole process. A lot of people think that, you know- you know, braces hurt and, you know, like you got train tracks on your teeth, so you get insecure about that but I was actually really happy about doing it. So, yeah.
    </p>
    <p>Eliot: Um, so you found your passion in dentistry in middle school?
    </p>
    <p>Brandon: Yeah, yeah. 
    </p>
    <p>Eliot: So, as you delved into high school, how did you shape your, uh, high school life into helping you become, uh- like, how did it help you to, like, get into USC and then eventually major or graduate into-
    </p>
    <p>Brandon: I- I get what you're asking. Um, so I actually didn't really um focus too much on, you know, my, uh, my career stuff yet, you know, back in middle school and high school. Honestly, I was just like you guys, you know, just doing what I can to get through high school, you know, being a child, being a kid, living- living out my childhood is essentially what it was. Um, so I spent most of my time in high school, you know, volunteering, um, in a club called Interact and, you know, I- I've met a lot of, um, you know, dentists and people from different careers as well. So I wasn't, you know, I wasn't totally set on dentistry, but it was something that I was targeting for in the future, um, so my high school path wasn't necessarily, um, narrowed down towards, you know, getting into school just for orthodontics or dentistry yet. It was, you know, having fun as a teenager and, you know, getting to experience life for what it is and then, you know, towards senior year when I started applying for college apps, you know, I applied to USC just for the f- you know, just for the sake of it and, um, surprisingly I got in. So, from there, like, you know, my entire college experience has been tailored towards, you know, building myself up so that I can become a good candidate for dental school in the future.
    </p>
    <p>Eliot: What do you think, uh, helped you get into USC?
    </p>
    <p>Brandon: What helped me get to USC. I'd say it's my- my driven and altruistic self, um you know, throughout high school I spent most of my time as- Do you know what Interact is? 
    </p>
    <p>Bryan: Yeah, we have at our school.
    </p>
    <p>Brandon: Oh, you have one? Okay, so I was the president and the area director and so I spent a lot of time, you know, being involved in that community and, you know, delving into different areas of our community where we could help, you know, the underserved and just so that, you know, I- if you have an altruistic mindset, you know, you're always going to be there for someone regardless of whether or not, you know, you were there for yourself. And I'm not saying that you should do that, but, you know, it's good to be there for others and it's also just as important to be there for yourself and I felt like, you know, Interact helped me, you know, wire that mindset.
    </p>
    <p>Bryan: What's the- What do you think is the most important thing to you, uh- in, like, your life as a doctor, student, kind of just, what's the most important thing to you. Just- 
    </p>
    <p>Brandon: For me?
    </p>
    <p>Bryan: Just in general.
    </p>
    <p>Brandon: In general, the most important thing to me is my family.
    </p>
    <p>Bryan: Is that what drives you?
    </p>
    <p>Brandon: That's what drives me. So the reason why, you know, I- I try my best to do all I can, you know, for myself in school to- to be a productive human being, to be, you know, a good samaritan in our communities is because, you know, I- I wanted to give back to my family, you know, my family didn't grow up in the best conditions, you know, we had our financial problems we had our.. our mental health setbacks and, you know, a lot of fights growing up, but there's- I don't think there's anything more heartwarming than, you know, seeing your family progressively get better and healthier and so, you know, the reason why I, you know, try my best in school and, you know, do my best to become a better person, you know, so I can get my- get into my future career and, you know, become, you know- and have my own family is because, you know, I want my family to- to have someone to be proud of, you know, and so I can give back to them, you know, in terms of finances, resources, and just be there for them in whatever way I can.
    </p>
    <p>Eliot: Um, so you're in your fourth year at USC?
    </p>
    <p>Brandon: Yeah.
    </p>
    <p>Eliot: And I've heard a lot that college is all about just connections, uh, do you agree with that?
    </p>
    <p>Brandon: Honestly, going to USC, I would say yes, you know, USC is known as one of the top, you know, business schools in the entire world so, um, I'd say on a day-to-day basis, you know, I'm always surrounded by business students and these guys are all about their grind in terms of, you know, networking and, you know, meeting new people and, you know, finding the right people that get- that will get them to where they need to be. But I'd also say the same applies to every other major, you know, like, you know, throughout your college experience, you should be meeting people, you know, having them, you know, give you advice on, you know, how to attain your goals because you can't get through life without the help of others, you know. If you try to navigate through your life without, you know- on your own, you're probably going to get stuck and lost somewhere along the lines. So yeah I'd say, you know, college is- a big part of it is networking and so you're probably gonna, you know, aside from, like, the fun stuff like the parties and whatnot, you know, there are a lot of events where you get to, you know, meet people who are already in their professions and those are the people that you look to to help you get to where you need to be.
    </p>
    <p>Bryan: Do you have any regrets from high school or first three years of college?
    </p>
    <p>Brandon: My regret? Honestly. Yes, I do have some regrets. Throughout my first two years, you know, I spent some of that time in a fraternity. I'd say I enjoyed the experience, but I wouldn't say it helped me towards, you know, getting closer to my career or my dreams. You know, I met some great people, I had some wonderful experiences and, you know, I'd say those are essential in building your character and they're- they're essential to help you, you know, understand who you are and what you want in life and so, that part is not a regret of mine. You know, I got to understand myself a lot better. But had I spent that time, you know, in internship a lot sooner, you know, maybe.. maybe I'd not be too worried about, you know, dental school and whatnot, but, you know, you- you can't really change the past and all you can do is change your mindset towards the future and how you're going to attain it.
    </p>
    <p>Bryan: So, you wouldn't go back and change it.. if you could?
    </p>
    <p>Brandon: I mean, there- there's guilt associated with it, but I wouldn't change the past. You know, I treasure those experiences that I've made, you know, I- I've met some wonderful people and, you know, the reason why I'm here today are because of some of these people, so.
    </p>
    <p>Bryan: So you think it helped, like, shape you?
    </p>
    <p>Brandon: It shaped my character. Definitely. It shaped my drive and my motivation to keep working hard.
    </p>
    <p>Bryan: What continues to motivate you?
    </p>
    <p>Brandon: What continues to motivate me? Honestly, I'd say.. It's just my drive towards becoming the best version of myself I can be. There's nothing better than, you know, knowing that, you know, today you were better than you were yesterday. You know, whatever you were able to complete today and achieve today, you weren't able to do yesterday, that- that is enough for me to get through my life and, you know, looking back 10 years- looking back 10 years ago, um you know, my life wasn't like now, you know. My family wasn't in the best conditions and, you know, the relationships I had weren't with the best people but today, you know, I'd say, like, I've become more mature as a person, I've become more confident in myself and so, you know, just comparing those two things like, you know, knowing that you can become a better person tomorrow, that's enough of a drive. 
    </p>
    <p>Eliot: Um, so as a junior in high school, I wish- Like, there's a lot of things I wish I could have like done sooner, such as, like, studying for the SAT, I wish I did that, like, way- like more before, are there any, like, things that you wish you could have done earlier or sooner?
    </p>
    <p>Brandon: Honestly, um, [the] first couple years of college, you know, being in the fraternity, you know- There was a time where I was really on top of my grades, but then there came a semester where I was going through family problems and I had to take a leave of absence. So coming back into school and being the president of the fraternity was a huge juggle. I was having, you know, trouble trying to balance my classes and be a president and be a good family member so, you know, honestly at that time I feel like I should have just dropped the fraternity and focused more on my studies because now there's that one- or two semesters- two semesters where, you know, my grades did, you know, suffer and I wish I had spent more time in that instead. You know, now as a senior I haven't taken the DAT yet but, you know, I plan on taking it in the upcoming spring, so I'm dedicating all my time to doing well in school now, you know, doing the best I can to set myself up in a better position for all my future, you know, academic endeavors.
    </p>
    <p>Bryan: And just before we end, do you have any advice for.. future generations, future people that want to be doctors or just general advice?
    </p>
    <p>Brandon: Work as hard as you can. Work like there's no tomorrow. You know, if today, you know, you're looking at your work, youâ€™re like, nah I'll do it tomorrow.. you gotta do it today, do it now. You know, like, if you keep living like, you know, tomorrow is always promised, you know, you're going to miss out on a lot of your life and, you know, you're going to miss out on your potential so- so don't- don't procrastinate.
    </p>
    <p>Bryan: Okay. Thank you.
    </p>
    <p>Eliot: Thank you.
    </p>
    <p>Brandon: Of course.
