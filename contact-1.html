    <h1>Mina Simonyan</h1>
    <p>Bryan: Um, can you start with your name and occupation first, please?</p>
    <p>
        Ms. Simonyan: My name is Mina Simonyan, and I'm a registered nurse.
    </p>
    <p>Bryan: Okay. So first off, um, what- what does a registered nurse do exactly?</p>
    <p>
        Ms. Simonyan: So nursing, there's about, like, three different specialties of nursing. Not specialties, but credentialing that's involved in nursing. There's a nurse's assistant who basically does the basic duties of patient care, checking blood pressure. And then there's a licensed vocational nurse. Their practice mainly involves taking care of patients also, but it's less responsibilities: passing out regular medications, filling out paperwork, checking blood pressure. And then there's a registered nurse. A registered nurse, you need to go to school for that. You need to be certified, licensed for it. And I guess there's so many different specialties in it. It all involves- the schooling and the licensing, it's pretty much the same thing. </p> 
    <p>Bryan: How come you decided to become a nurse rather than a doctor?</p>
    <p>Ms. Simonyan: I don't know, I never even thought about being a doctor. I always saw myself as being a nurse, so the doctor wasn't even an option for me. </p>
    <p>Eliot: I'm actually,like, a volunteer at a hospital, and I saw that I usually either call for a CP or an RN. And you're an RN. What's the difference between a CP and an RN?</p>
    <p>Ms. Simonyan: I don't know what a CP is. I guess in some hospitals, I'll give you an example, the reason that's probably why I don't know what it is. Like licensed vocational nurses, some hospitals call them licensed vocational nurses, LVNs. Some hospitals call them practical nurses. So I don't know what the hospital uses that job description for, so I don't know.</p>
    <p>Eliot: Uh, let me do a different question. So were you always set on being a nurse? Or was it something that you kind of just stumbled upon?</p>
    <p>Ms. Simonyan: I knew I wanted to be in the medical field for nursing, but not necessarily sure what type of nurse. Like a vocational nurse, medical assistant, but I started as a surgical technician. So I went to school, got certified, and what I would do basically was assist in surgeries, manage instruments, assist in surgical procedures. That was my stepping stone into nursing because I wanted to see how one becomes a nurse, what is involved, how much schooling is required, and the difficulty in that. It was pretty challenging because there are so many programs out there, and you want to find out which one works best for you. You know, if you have a few years to wait and get into a waiting list program for a nursing program, or do you want to take out a loan or pay out of pocket and go to a private nursing school? So there are options, and that worked best for me, so I did a surgical technician for 4, 5 years, and I did my prerequisites at the Los Angeles Valley College. And I got in a waiting room- a waiting list program, and I got in a program. It took me about a year and a half, but I was okay because I was already working as a surgical technician, I was already in the hospital, so I got familiar with the profession and the specifics of it, the pay, the flexibility, the requirements, and I figured most nurses that become LVNs, they proceed to become registered nurses. So I figured I'll just save myself some time and just keep all that and just go straight to a registered nurse. That's how I stumbled upon it, I guess.</p>
    <p>Bryan: So we know that nurses are, like, the backbone of healthcare. They're kind of doing all the.. like the grunt work, kind of. How do you stay motivated in such a stressful environment?</p>
    <p>Ms. Simonyan: I guess my main motivation is my patients.. because in the end that's why I do what I do, just because at the end of the day I know that if I go to work, well- I work 12 hours, so in 12 hours I have made a lot of patients happy or satisfied. So I have contributed, I have done something where I can say, I am satisfied with my job, even though it's stressful. I guess we all have tough days, but that's my motivation, just knowing that I'm doing something good and that I'm doing something that I love, and I made a career out of it. And the other motivation is that if I get tired of what I do, and there are so many other options I have where I can go to something else, I am not stuck in the profession until I retire.</p>
    <p>Eliot: What did your highschool experience- Like, what was your high school experience like?</p>
    <p>Ms. Simonyan: My high school experience? My high school experience was awful, because I came- Well, I'm not an immigrant anymore, I'm a citizen, and I came into this country as an immigrant when I was 14 or 15, so I did a few months of junior high and then I went on to high school. High school was awful for me because I knew three languages, but I didn't know English, so I had to start with ABCs. And that was pretty challenging because I was taking a lot of courses, kind of like a crash course of high school. I didn't have summers off because I was doing summer school to keep up with them, to graduate on time. So high school wasn’t that great. I graduated on time, but it was extremely tough.</p>
    <p>Eliot: In high school, did you do anything exceptional to stand out?</p>
    <p>Ms. Simonyan: No, I did not. I did not have time for any extracurricular or any other activities besides completing my courses, and I was working also.</p>
    <p>Bryan: Do you ever question your decision in becoming a nurse?</p>
    <p>Ms. Simonyan: No.</p>
    <p>Bryan: You're happy that you did it and you don't regret it at all?</p>
    <p>Ms. Simonyan: No.</p>
    <p>Eliot: Wait. So in the hospitals, I see that, like, a lot of nurses kinda- they can mess up sometimes or have stressful moments. Did you have a specific story where that happened to you?</p>
    <p>Ms. Simonyan: I have a lot. I just don't know which one.... Yeah, I have so many, I'm just trying to think of a good one where it's not too long of a story because-...I can't think of one right now. Do you guys have any other questions I can answer while I'm thinking about that one?</p>
    <p>Bryan: Would you recommend being a nurse to other people, whether they're children or, like, teenagers, would you recommend your job?</p>
    <p>Ms. Simonyan: Definitely.</p>
    <p>Bryan: Definitely?</p>
    <p>Ms. Simonyan: We have a saying that nurses eat their young, meaning that when there's a new nurse coming on board and we have to train them, we're very tough with them. That's primarily because most nurses out there have been in the profession for so long, they're becoming very burnt out or resentful, but they forget about all that, they take it out on the mentee over training, and they don't recommend other people to become a nurse. But I do because it's great, especially for a young person, because nursing is so flexible and broad. You don’t have to be- You don't have to work in a hospital, you can be a forensic nurse, you can work with criminal cases; you can be into informatics, which is basically computer science in healthcare; you can be an army nurse; you can be a travel nurse, you can travel the world; you can be a flight nurse, you can jump off a helicopter. It's great, it gives you a lot of opportunities. So yes, and they say that you shouldn't because it's also very stressful. Yes, it is, but a lot of things in life are. So yes, I would recommend it.</p>
    <p>Bryan: Is the stress the most difficult part about being a nurse, or are there more difficult things?</p>
    <p>Ms. Simonyan: The stress, yes, and the politics. Just like everything else, nursing has politics. It's very challenging for us to concentrate on patient care and do what we're supposed to do when there's a lot of loopholes and red tape we have to go through to do what we're supposed to do. So I guess politics would be another challenge for us.
    </p>
    <p>Eliot: So nurses have like 12 hour shifts. What's your schedule looking like? Is it like four days a week?</p>
    <p>Ms. Simonyan: Not all of them. Like if you work in a clinic, you mainly do nine to five. If you work in urgent care, you may be six hours, eight hours, or ten hours. Hospitals are going away- they're phasing out the eight-hour shifts. So I would say 98% of our staff is 12 hours. So I work seven p to seven a. So I work 12 hours and I do three days a week.
    </p>
    <p>Bryan: Do you have that story you thought up, or?
    </p>
    <p>Ms. Simonyan: I guess a mess-up, no, well, in a way it's a mess-up. Sometimes I act as a charge nurse. Charge nurse basically meaning that I'm in charge of the shift. I'm responsible for patient assignments. I'm responsible for the patients. I made an assignment with a contract nurse and I assumed she knew her role in the job description. And I wasn't familiar with her background and her skills. And, there was a patient - I don’t wanna get into specifics I guess - patient harm, not a big harm, just a minor, only because the nurse didn't know what she was doing. And she complained to my supervisor that I did not check with her her skill level before I made the assignment. But in the end, I don't have to check her skill level because it's just a common nursing practice that she didn't follow. And that's why the harm happened.
    </p>
    <p>Eliot: And the assignment is like the paper and you assign the nurses to the patients?
    </p>
    <p>Ms. Simonyan: Right, so each shift we have, for example, if we have 10 patients and I have five nurses scheduled to work that shift, then we have to make the assignment so that it's fair, so that it's doable. And we assigned, for example, two patients per nurse. And then if one of the patients is discharged and another patient is admitted, we figure out which nurse is going to take the next patient. 
    </p>
    <p>Eliot: And then I found that- So with the charge nurse, there's also the NCT and the resource nurse, is that right?
    </p>
    <p>Ms. Simonyan: Oh, I'm sorry?
    </p>
    <p>Eliot: Along with the charge nurse, working with the charge nurse is the NCT nurse, the NCT and the resource nurse, right?
    </p>
    <p>Ms. Simonyan: I don't know what an NCT is, it's probably, I don't know what that is. I do have- we do have resource nurse, like I said, because each hospital has different name for the position. But we do have resource nurse and our resource nurse basically is responsible for covering for breaks. So lunch breaks and the other breaks. And whatever else the unit needs help with.
    </p>
    <p>Bryan: Before we end, do you have any advice for people looking to be nurses or just general advice for people?
    </p>
    <p>Ms. Simonyan: My advice is don't go into nursing if you don't like it.. That’s because nowadays a lot of people think that, yes, it's a guaranteed career, you'll never be out of a job. The pay's pretty good, but are you going to like what you do? Because not every day is going to be great, not every patient is going to be great. If you cannot stand bodily fluids, if you cannot stand blood- You don't have to do that for a career, but in nursing school you're required. So you really have to like what you do. If you don't, you might not be a good nurse.
    </p>
    <p>Bryan & Eliot: Thank you.
    </p>
    <p>Ms. Simonyan: You're welcome.
