    <h1>Woo Paek</h1>
    <p>Bryan: Um, can you start with your name and occupation first, please?
    </p>
    <p>Dr. Paek: My name is Woo Paek, M.D. Uh, I'm a pediatrician- uh, general pediatrician, uh means- meaning not a specialized pediatrician, but a pediatric doctor that's considered, like, the primary care doctor for, uh, children up to usually about age of 18 and also to their family I guess as well. Uh, let's see, what else? Um, uh, I went to school in the Los Angeles area, graduated from UC Santa Barbara, uh, and then I graduated from a medical school in the Caribbeans actually. So called St. George's University, uh, and then after that I did my residency in Miami at Miami Children's, I did one year of a fellowship at Children's Hospital LA at critical care, after that I uh worked as a hospitalist, which I sometimes still do because I'm wearing uh my uh hospitalist coat top- uh, lab coat right now although I don't usually wear lab coats, but, you know, since you guys are recording, I want to look as professional as possible to you guys, uh, when we're doing this yes. And then- and also I also have a private practice aside from being a hospitalist. Hospitalist means basically a doctor that works mainly for patients who are, uh, who are hospitalized. So the hospitalist takes care of patients who are hospitalized in the hospital, whereas primary care general practitioners usually have their own small community office, which I have, and take care of patients who are not in the hospital, but for other medical needs outside of being in an acute sick situation.
    </p>
    <p>Bryan: Okay so can you explain what exactly- what a pediatrician does as opposed to any other doctor.
    </p>
    <p>Dr. Paek: Yes it's a very broad topic, um, in the end, you know, my job is to make sure that when a kid, a baby- as soon as a baby is born until- up to about certain age or stage, um, the main, main goal is that I make sure that they they develop to their full potential in terms of their medical potential as well as their other potentials because if you make sure that they're not sick, they're growing adequately, uh, they're achieving- well when you're young, you need to make sure that they're achieving milestones. Things like, are they walking, you know, simple things that we take for granted, you know, sometimes some kids don't do that as well when they're young. Are they talking at a certain age, are they doing some stuff, are they role playing, are they, uh, you know, are they doing things at their appropriate age that is appropriate for them. And a general pediatrician's biggest job is to make sure that that is happening with their patients, that they are not falling behind, uh, because then that- because you there's not- I mean there are teachers, there's other people who may be able to say ah, you know, but when the kids are- babies are very young, there's not many people out there who are able to take on that job to make sure that when you're two months old, four months old, six months old, one year, one and a half year, are they doing what they're supposed to do at that age. And that is the main, main job. Now, aside from that, obviously if a kid, baby, infant, if they get sick, let's say they catch a cold, or they're vomiting, or they're, you know, where they get injured, then I'm also there to make sure that they're okay and they heal well. Um, personally, you know, I think that is a very important job and I think that a lot of people think that that's what doctors jobs are, but primary care uh doctors, their most important job is to make sure that you are developing normally, that you are, um, that you are not falling behind and that you are given as much potential to do what you could do in the future and not to miss if there is something that is making you fall behind. Uh, an example that may encompass anything is- everything we- let's say if a kid falls, two-year-old not walking, running very well, climbing everything falls, hits their head, and now there's skull fracture bleeding in the head. Initially we fix, you know, we fix that, we make sure the bleeding stops, brain looks okay, but then, what's the damage that's been done? So the pediatrician needs to make sure one day, one month, one year down the line is that- did that injury cause any long lasting effect. And that's sort of the part of the job of a general pediatrician, to make sure that, not just acutely, but from throughout the growth and development of a patient, that they're achieving what they're supposed to achieve. So I think that would be the main job. 
    </p>
    <p>Bryan: So you work with, like, infants- Okay. Since you're working with, like, infants and younger kids, what's the scariest part about working with that age group?
    </p>
    <p>Dr. Paek: Uh, at what age group?
    </p>
    <p>Bryan: Like infants to, um, young adults.
    </p>
    <p>Dr. Paek: So, uh, let's say as soon as the baby's born, the first thing you want to make sure that they're breathing, right, and believe it or not, that issue comes up a lot. Uh, as soon as the baby's born, so we have to make sure that the babies are doing the basic things: breathing, eating, urinating, uh making poop. Simple stuff that we think that all babies should do very easily, can come very difficult when they're first born. Um, and then, once you make sure those things are okay, then, everything is just stepwise that- are they doing something else, are they doing something else, at what- at one month of age, are they making eye contact and following you a little bit. I mean, these are just like one example among many other things. At two months of ag,e are they smiling; at four months of age, are they, like, babbling and things like that; by six months, are they uh flipping over, going from their stomach to their back; by nine months, are they sitting, are they able to sit and grab with two hands, passing objects one object to another; at one year of age, we expect them to grab onto something and stand up and move sideways; by 15 months of age, we expect them to say mama, dada, maybe one other word; at 18 months of age, they should start climbing stairs and putting blocks on top of each other; by two years of age, you should start singing a little bit, uh, putting two words together, playing hide and seek; uh, two and a half, um, you should start saying other people's name at about two and a half years of age; three months- uh, three years of age, maybe you start like pedaling a little bit, uh, drawing circles; four years, you're starting to draw faces, you're starting to count, like maybe up to 20; by five years of age, you're making knots, uh, you're putting on- you're able to put on buttons. Things like that, I mean those are very, like, small examples of what we look for as ages- as they develop, uh, but basically so there's certain milestones that we look for at [a] certain age. Now for you, you're now, uh, 16, right?
    </p>
    <p>Bryan: Yeah.
    </p>
    <p>Dr. Paek: At 16 years of age, uh, my main concern- usually at 16 is, uh, you're not as physically sick or we don't look for those physical developments as much. We look for more mental stuff. Like, for instance, depression, anxiety, uh, risk taking, uh, are you doing drugs, alcohol, are you doing some risky behavior like driving, you know. Although, you know, I- when I turned 16 I- you know, that's the first thing I really wanted to do and, uh- so but things like that. Um, and uh, you know, depression, anxiety which is a lot more prevalent in the last few years than ever that i've seen, yes. 
    </p>
    <p>Eliot: Um, so I'm sure like a pedia- being a pediatrician is way different than just being like a, like, a surgeon.
    </p>
    <p>Dr. Paek: Yes.
    </p>
    <p>Eliot: Um, so was it- was there any difference in residency? What was that like?
    </p>
    <p>Dr. Paek: Yes, very good question. So, uh, residency usually is broken down. The first year is usually called the intern. And in most residencies the intern, um you know, they'll do their specialty stuff if you're like, let's say a surgeon or uh you're a radiologist, you'll do that, but the main idea being the first year intern is to actually kind of learn what goes on in a hospital, uh, so that after you complete that internship, you know, you may become specialized- even more specialized after that. But the idea of an intern is to basically stay in the hospital and you learn how the hospital functions. Um, and if you need to, uh, and if you- if somehow something happens, then you're ready enough to, like, let's say you were gonna be a surgeon and you did an internship, but you're like, oh my god, that that is not for me so I'm gonna do something else. At least you have that one year of internship in so that you could kind of pivot if you need to. Um, after that, um, then you specialize a little more. So most residencies need at least three years total: so one year of internship, two years of residency, but the three combined years is usually considered a one whole residency. Uh, if you're a surgeon, it's usually five years, uh, and then after that, you- if you want to specialize, depends on what you want to specialize in, what field, and that could be anywhere from another one year to another five years. Let's say  the most- I have a friend, a very close friend of mine, uh, who is a pediatric cardiothoracic surgeon and his training after medical school was 12 years. So I became a full functioning pediatrician after three years of residency, he needed another nine years after that training, yeah. So it could be very different.
    </p>
    <p>Eliot: Um, so you said that, um, during that one year intern- Oh sorry. Uh, during that one year intern, a lot of people can choose whether to continue or choose a different path?
    </p>
    <p>Dr. Paek: If you- You rarely see people- By that time, you're so old and you've gone through that process so much and you have to basically sort of apply even before internship what you wanted to do, so it's- it would be very rare after one year internship for you to just change gear and do something else. Yeah.
    </p>
    <p>Eliot: So you were always set on becoming a pediatrician?
    </p>
    <p>Dr. Paek: By the third year of medical school, yeah I kind of- I realized I wanted to be a pediatrician, yes.
    </p>
    <p>Eliot: What made you want to become a pediatrician?
    </p>
    <p>Dr. Paek: There's many factors. I’d like to say it's the money but it's not. That's the worst factor of being a pediatrician. Um, so if you're a- um, so I have to sort of decide, okay. I like meeting patients and I like taking care of patients, but when when you're going to like internal medicine and things like that, you tend to see a lot more older people, uh, so the idea of a internal medicine person will be- most of the patients that you'll be seeing and taking care of are, like you know, 60s 70s 80s dealing with chronic medical problems, you know, blood pressure and things like that. Um, and I didn't want to really do that. I, you know, I didn't want to have to see people- I mean, this is kind of [a] really cruel way of saying it, I didn't want to have to see people slowly die, I guess is a very not nice way of putting it. I'd rather see more of babies growing up and becoming a full-fledged adult. Not necessarily, uh, prolonging somebody else's happiness and life for their decline is one way. That was a major reason, it's not the reason, there's other reasons why- You know, I didn't want to be a surgeon because I could tell you that, you know, my surgical rotation was not- I did not have fun, so I just I didn't want to become, like, a surgeon; I didn't want to become an OB-GYN; uh, radiologist, I didn't want to do that because you're always in a dark room all the time, although nowadays I don't know, like, with this, like, you could be almost anywhere in the world and be a radiologist, I guess. But anyways that was a major reason. So I knew that I was going to be in some sort of, like, a medicine kind of field and within the medicine, which field would I be most happy at, in terms of, not financially but maybe as a goal towards what I was going to do as my job.
    </p>
    <p>Bryan: In middle school and high school, did you always think that you were going to be a doctor, did you always want to be a doctor?
    </p>
    <p>Dr. Paek: My parents have pushed that all the time and I'm sure that kind of happens with you guys too, they push that so it was always in the back of my mind but I- trust me, I was not a distinguished high school student. In my class I was not- I wasn't the top 20 percent um you know uh- I did go to UC Santa Barbara, at that time not as prestigious as it is now, i'll tell you that okay much easier to get into UC Santa Barbara during my time than it is right now- um but even while I was attending UC Santa Barbara I didn't- I didn't- I did major in a science field but you know I knew that it was going to be a long shot for me to like try to go to medical school right away. Um so I actually took about three years after medical school and I- and me and my other friend, we tried to actually start a trading firm believe it or not where we would buy and sell stuff to Korea from the United States. That did not work out well uh- and I realized and that's when I had kind of like ‘oh yeah I got to do something that is a little more stable’. So and then so after that uh you know I refocused on what I needed to do to get into medical school and go on this path, but yes um- did I always know I was going to be out there? No, my parents pushed it there's- there's- that part is true, but when I graduated from university I think going to medical school was- was like very far distant back in my mind. I knew it was a very remote possibility but not my major thing. 
    </p>
    <p>Bryan: So is there a turning point in college for you like, ‘I think medicine is right for me’ or was that kind of from your parents pushing it on you?
    </p>
    <p>Dr. Paek: My friends, the friends that went through the traditional way of becoming I have- I have- I actually have four high school friends or who I'm still very close to who became doctors. They went through more of a traditional path, they kind of knew that they were going to go to- try to go to medical school as soon as they were in high school. So they knew what kind of path to choose, what to do, who to ask, how to go about, so they went through it most- most- mostly traditionally. Knowing their parents, they've kind of probably pushed it a little bit um- yeah it's unfortunate you know, I hate to say that they all became and they're happy with what they're doing by the way and like none of them are like really unhappy about being a doctor. I think most doctors are happier than most lawyers if you want- if you ask my opinion about it. Um but they were a lot more focused on what they wanted to do, they knew what they were going to do um- it's not just the parents, you need to be invested in it, you need to say I I'm willing to do this and i'll do this, that's way more important than what parents pushes upon you. Um so just I don't know if you play sports or anything if you really want to be good at something and I'm not comparing like being a doctor to being like a professional baseball, I'm not doing that but in anything in life I always feel that if you really want to be good in something the parents should support you but it is the person, you need to be invested in it. You can't do it because somebody else is pushing this on you, you have to say I want to do this and then you have the support from the parents and things like that you know. But so- so I although you know there is a theme about where uh- you know especially among high achieving students that the parents really push them to do this so they do it. I really think that's really overblown you know. Most doctors I know, knew they were going to be doctors one way or the other. Now would they regret it later on a lot, some did- yes, and I know few doctors and who- who I know a doctor after about halfway through residency, ‘forget it this is not my life’ and just quit. They did something else. Um but you know but- but they were dedicated to go there from before, once they got into a certain state they decided they didn't want that life. So I think while in high school and middle school um- if you have that drive to want to get into the field of medicine, I think that's very important for your later happiness if you get into that field. 
    </p>
    <p>Eliot: Uh and you said you weren't really like a top student at- during high school?
    </p>
    <p>Dr. Paek: Well- well I have to say, I had a lot of friends who were very high achievers uh- I uh- so I went to a sort of like a little bit of a specialized school so it's considered you know the- the students were highly motivated and highly achieving so among that group, I was not the top student i'll admit that readily to you, yes. There are other paths, you don't have to- you don't have to be number one in your class at every moment to be a doctor, I know plenty of people who have taken alternate paths and I'm probably an example of that. 
    </p>
    <p>Eliot: So uh how are you able to like stand out and get into-? 
    </p>
    <p>Dr. Paek: Yeah that's a very great question, you know- and I do get this question quite a time. You know you could- you could do the traditional thing where you're the top student in your class uh- go to- go to a top uh- university in their top engineer, that's how you basically you know the the smartest people usually are the engineers, engineers in top universities, and then- and then to do some chemical engineering or some sort of engineering and then be the top of that, and then get into a medical school. That is the- that is sort of the way like you, uh- it's a simple but the most difficult path because you're trying to compete against, you know- tens of thousands of others who're going to try to do that. The sort of the more untraditional way of the way people may do so to stand out. I know people who are philosophy majors uh- who went to medical school uh- I know who were going through like was going to become a lawyer and then he decided he wanted to go to medical school. So- so as long as you are focused on what you want to do, you know- you don't have to do exactly the way what people think you need to do- and as long as. So and how do you stand out, you know- that is a very difficult question to answer. You know, it is a crapshoot in some ways. Even now as you guys are preparing to apply to college or even applying to college right now, you realize that it's- it's almost like a lottery sometimes you know- why did some people get into this university while this person did not when obviously this person was way more qualified than that person. And that happens at every step out of the way believe it or not, so it will happen when you guys are going into college, it'll happen after college and, you'll have- even happen after medical school because after medical school you have to apply to certain programs as well for- for residency. Um If you do- if you're not- if you are not doing something traditional, don't worry too much about it as long as you're focused on what you want to do and as long as people know that you're focused on what you want to do. Even if you're like, you know- majoring in English and I do know an English major who went to medical school, as long as you do the prerequisite courses, take the MCAT and that's one of the ways that you could really stand out. I'm not saying that you should do that by the way, that would not be a good advice uh- because that's- that's sort of like the yeah- that's the untraditional- maybe in some ways easier, but that's gonna be much harder to do than than the other- like the traditional way of just trying to beat everybody else in- in- in- in science and in engineering, getting into something like that, yeah. 
    </p>
    <p>Eliot: Um what was the MCAT like? 
    </p>
    <p>Dr. Paek: MCAT? 
    </p>
    <p>Eliot: Yeah. 
    </p>
    <p>Dr. Paek: It's very different from, I guess from what I did, I mean I took MCAT- you need to know a certain amount of biology, physics, um- uh biochem, organic chemistry, and then there was sort of the humanities written portions that- that you need to know of. But I think the test has- has evolved a little bit since then. 
    </p>
    <p>Eliot: Oh okay. 
    </p>
    <p>Bryan: And before we end, do you have any advice for aspiring doctor or any general advice that you think people need to hear?
    </p>
    <p>Dr. Paek: I- I- oh in some ways I think you guys are so young to even be worried about something like this, you know. I think you guys need to have fun, college should be a fun experience, that is the most you know- I had most fun when I was in college. Maybe too much fun, but that was the most fun I had in my life. And- and you know it's I- yes- yes the focus needs to be there but don't get too pressured by it, there's if- let's say if you don't become a doctor it's fine okay, being a doctor is not that big of a deal. I'll tell you that right now, you know- it's- it's a, you know- this is the biggest glory I have, being interviewed by perspective- we joked all the time. We would be at a medical library when I was a student and it was like you go down to like USC medical library, at the bottom there's a big picture of this supposed to really famous doctor uh- from the 1930s and we say nobody remembers him, that's you know- nobody remembers who that guy is. But he has a nice big picture at the, you know- at the basement of a library. So I guess- so I guess what I'm trying to say is if you don't become a doctor it is not the end of the world, it's- there's plenty of other things out there in life. Uh I- my- during when I was going to medical school, I had friends who got into uh- computer science and- and do like startups at- at- uh in Silicon Valley and trust me they have way more money than I do. So uh, you know-  it's not- this is not just a one-way street. 
    </p>
    <p>Bryan and Eliot: Okay, thank you, thank you doctor. 
    </p>
    <p>Dr. Paek: Hey good talking to you guys, well I hope this was helpful. 
    </p>
    <p>Bryan: It was great, thank you.
    </p>
    <p>Dr. Paek: Take care, bye bye. 
    </p>
    <p>Eliot: Thank you 
    </p>
    <p>Bryan: Thank you
